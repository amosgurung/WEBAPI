OAuth tokens should not be granted in the main flow, assuming the user has sent in the correct credentials
because of security reasons. If a person were to acquire the source code and the OAuth tokens were granted
in the main flow, then every that was being secured would be compromised. If the OAuth tokens were granted
in a separate flow then we could encrypt it and then decrypt it at runtime so that the information would
remain secure even if someone were to acquire the node code.
